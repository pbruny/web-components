# HTML & CSS Web Components

## Hey!

In this repo, I'll be adding some basic web components built up with HTML, CSS and sometimes JS.

My goal doing this is to practice my skills with the foundation of web development, since I also develop with React, Javascript is not the main focus here.

Inside of each component will have a short description and a screenshot.
